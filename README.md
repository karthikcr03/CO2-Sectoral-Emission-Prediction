# Sectoral CO₂ Emission Forecasting

This project was developed during an internship at **Eastern Michigan University, China**, and focuses on forecasting carbon emissions from various sectors. Using historical data and multiple estimation algorithms, the project aims to identify the most effective model for predicting which sectors—such as coal, methane, and oil—contribute most to greenhouse warming.

## 🌍 Project Objective

- **Goal**: Predict CO₂ emissions across sectors and determine which ones significantly impact the atmosphere.
- **Approach**: Compare the performance of multiple algorithms to find the best-suited model for accurate sectoral forecasting.
- **Outcome**: Support policy-makers and environmental researchers in targeting high-emission sectors for climate action.

## 📁 Files

- `main3.ipynb`: Primary notebook for preprocessing, modeling, and comparison of algorithms.
- `lstm.ipynb`: Deep learning approach using LSTM for time series-based emission forecasting.

## 🧪 Features

- Historical data ingestion and preprocessing
- Sector-wise CO₂ emission analysis
- Integration of government/NGO data (if available)
